4) copy legendary.pass to home folder
5) set right permission for html folder (755)

THINGS THAT MIGHT DEPEND ON SERVER:

1) in database.manager.py specify path for self.database_path

One can use "$_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER']" in order to find the current user logged in with htaccess

TO USE PYTHON FILES INSTEAD OF HTML OR PHP

1) Add following options for the directory with .py files (either in apache2.conf or sites-availabe/default):
	<Directory /path/to/directory>
		Options +ExecCGI
		AddHandler cgi-script .py
	</Directory>

2) Make sure that the script is executable for others (give it at least 755 permissions)
3) Script file has to start with: "#!/usr/bin/python3"
4) make sure the first thing printed by the script is: "Content-type:text/html\r\n\r\n"
